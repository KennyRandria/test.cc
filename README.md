# Refactor Overview
In this refactor, the code has been enhanced for readability and maintainability. Here are the key improvements:

# Switch-Case Statement: 
Replaced multiple if-else statements with a switch-case statement in the simulateRiceCooker function for better structure and clarity.

# Code Organization: 
The code is organized into a riceCooker object, containing methods to perform various actions. This enhances code modularity and readability.

# Removed Redundant Variable: 
Removed the unnecessary condition variable and directly used the while (true) loop for simplicity.

# Documentation: 
Added comments to clarify the purpose of each function and section of the code.
